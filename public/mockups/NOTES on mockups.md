# college-score-card-visualizer

## Home/Login Page Thoughts
* simplified but bold design would combat the busy & boring designs of competitors 
* do we like a nav bar or buttons or both?
* how do we feel about advertising our application on the home page i.e. what you will get if you sign up
    * using cards etc 

## Results Page Thoughts:
* competitors seem to use either endless scroll or verticle list of cards
* we could replicate this style 
    * this would seem to work well if we want to display a lot of data
* tabs or carosel may be a way to stand out from the endless scroll
    * allow us to showcase a smaller/focused collection of data points
    * used carosel in mock up but interested in checking out .nav-tabs 
    * some next steps would be choosing our main or a first couple of data points to begin imagining the display
* we could also combine these by including more plainly displayed data below the main set
